# Granular
Granular is a fine-grained performance evaluation framework for Big Data Processing (BDP) systems.

 * *Modeller* contains the official Granular patch (for creating performance log) and the performance model (for reading performance log) for each supported BDP systems.
 * *Archiver* converts the unorganized performance logs generated by Granular-patched BDP systems into a well-structured, self-contained Granular performance archive. 
 * *Visualizer* parses the Granular archive and visualizes the actual content.

Warning: the Granula project is in the pre-alpha stage, which is still subjected to major revisions in the coming months.
